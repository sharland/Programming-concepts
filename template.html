						<h2>How to use this slide-deck</h2>
						<p>This slide-deck uses either space or the right arrow to proceed and the left arrow to go back.  You can also use the controls in the bottom right-hand corner.</p>
						<p>Certain slides will have an additional arrow in the controls pointing down.  This means there are sub-slides underneath the main slides</p>
						<p>If you wish to see an overview of all the slides tap escape on your keyboard.</p>

					<h2>About this slide-deck</h2>
					<p>The objective of this slide deck is to quickly introduce you to the basic concepts of programming using xyz.</p>
					<p>Each top-level slide kicks of a lesson focussing on an aspect of programming using examples in the slides below the top-level slide.</p>
					<p>This series of lessons will use as much practical examples as possible in order to help ground you in learning how to code.</p>

						<h2>What is programming?</h2>
						<p>When you woke up this morning many of the things you used or did would have relied on instructions being performed by a computer.</p>
						<img src="img/coffeemachine1.jpg" />
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The coffee machine you or your parents would have used using basic instructions to control how the machine functions</p>
						<p>The electronic bus timetable at the bus-stop will be programmed to fetch information on bus arrivals.</p>
						<p>A smart TV or home automation device might be programmed to fetch the latest information about the weather from the web.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>All the instructions on these devices will have been written by a human to make sure the machine worked as expected.</p>
						<p>This is programming!  It is the process of writing sets of instructions in order to get a computer to perform a specific task.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Let's now move onto finding out how to actually create simple instructions on a computer that will lead to the computer doing something for you!</p>
						<p>Think of the control! Think of the power!</p>

						<h1>Variables</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Let's start by asking a few questions</h3>
						<p>How do you get to school?</p>
						<p>What's the temperature today? At this moment?</p>
						<p>What was the last score you got in your favourite computer game?</p>
						<p>Who is your favourite singer?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Values</h3>
						<p>The answers you would have given can be described as values</p>
						<p>These values could change.  If you came by bus to school today, tomorrow you could come by car.  The temperature is always changing and although Ariana Grande could be your favourite singer now, it could be someone different a year from now.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Each of these values can also be linked with a label or item which describes what its value is.</p>
						<p>For example:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Method of Transport (label) holds bus (value)</li>
							<li>tempToday (item) holds 19 (value)</li>
							<li>faveSinger = "Ariana Grande"
						</ol>
						<p>A variable is therefore a data item which holds a value which can be changed</p>
					</section>
