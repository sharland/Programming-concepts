						<h2>How to use this slide-deck</h2>
						<p>This slide-deck uses either space or the right arrow to proceed and the left arrow to go back.  You can also use the controls in the bottom right-hand corner.</p>
						<p>Certain slides will have an additional arrow in the controls pointing down.  This means there are sub-slides underneath the main slides</p>
						<p>If you wish to see an overview of all the slides tap escape on your keyboard.</p>

					<h2>About this slide-deck</h2>
					<p>The objective of this slide deck is to quickly introduce you to the basic concepts of programming using xyz.</p>
					<p>Each top-level slide kicks of a lesson focussing on an aspect of programming using examples in the slides below the top-level slide.</p>
					<p>This series of lessons will use as much practical examples as possible in order to help ground you in learning how to code.</p>

						<h2>What is programming?</h2>
						<p>When you woke up this morning many of the things you used or did would have relied on instructions being performed by a computer.</p>

					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The coffee machine you or your parents would have used using basic instructions to control how the machine functions</p>
						<p>The electronic bus timetable at the bus-stop will be programmed to fetch information on bus arrivals.</p>
						<p>A smart TV or home automation device might be programmed to fetch the latest information about the weather from the web.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>All the instructions on these devices will have been written by a human to make sure the machine worked as expected.</p>
						<p>This is programming!  It is the process of writing sets of instructions in order to get a computer to perform a specific task.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Let's now move onto finding out how to actually create simple instructions on a computer that will lead to the computer doing something for you!</p>
						<p>Think of the control!</p>
